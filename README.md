# Hosting a Dynamic Web Application on AWS

Welcome to our AWS deployment guide for hosting a dynamic web application. This project provides a robust architecture that ensures high availability, scalability, and security for your dynamic web applications.

## Architecture Overview

Refer to the architecture diagram provided in this repository for a visual guide. The AWS infrastructure setup includes:

1. **VPC**: A Virtual Private Cloud to host all the resources with public and private subnets across two Availability Zones (AZs) for fault tolerance.
2. **Internet Gateway**: To allow internet connectivity to the VPC.
3. **NAT Gateway**: Placed in the public subnet to allow instances in the private subnet to access the internet securely.
4. **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets in the Auto Scaling Group.
5. **Auto Scaling**: Automatically adjusts the number of instances during traffic spikes to maintain steady, predictable performance.
6. **EC2 Instances**: Web servers running within private subnets in different AZs to host the web application.
7. **Amazon RDS**: Master and standby databases in different AZs for data redundancy and high availability.
8. **S3 Bucket**: To store and retrieve any amount of data at any time.
9. **IAM Role with S3 Policy**: To securely control access to AWS services and resources for the EC2 instances.
10. **Amazon Route 53**: For DNS and traffic management.
11. **AWS Certificate Manager**: For managing SSL/TLS certificates.
12. **Simple Notification Service (SNS)**: For notifications and automating the publishing of messages.
13. **AMI**: Amazon Machine Images to quickly launch EC2 instances that are pre-configured.
14. **MySQL Workbench**: For database management.

## Deployment Steps

The following steps are a high-level guide to deploying a dynamic web application:

### 1. AWS Setup

- Set up your VPC with subnets, internet gateway, NAT gateways, and route tables as depicted in the architecture diagram.
- Define your Security Groups for ALB, EC2 instances, and RDS.
- Create an IAM role with S3 full access to be attached to EC2 instances.

### 2. Database Setup

- Launch an RDS instance in your private subnets, with a master in one AZ and a standby replica in another AZ for high availability.
- Configure your security groups to allow access from your EC2 instances.

### 3. Application Deployment

- Launch an EC2 instance using the AMI with your web application's environment pre-configured.
- If your application requires, attach an EFS for shared storage between instances.
- Configure the application to connect to the RDS database instance.
- Store static assets in the S3 bucket and set up proper bucket policies.

### 4. Load Balancer and Scaling

- Set up an Application Load Balancer in public subnets, directing traffic to the EC2 instances in private subnets.
- Create an Auto Scaling Group and define scaling policies based on the traffic.

### 5. Domain, SSL, and SNS

- Register a domain with Route 53 and configure the DNS settings.
- Use AWS Certificate Manager to create and manage an SSL certificate for your domain.
- Set up SNS topics to send notifications regarding scaling activities and other notifications as needed.

### 6. Continuous Monitoring and Management

- Implement Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring the performance of your EC2 instances, RDS databases, and other AWS services.
- Use AWS CloudTrail for governance, compliance, operational auditing, and risk auditing of your AWS account.
